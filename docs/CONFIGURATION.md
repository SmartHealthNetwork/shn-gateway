# Configuration reference

The gateway is configured entirely by environment variables. `SHN_DISCOVERY_URL`
resolves almost everything else; a typical deployment sets only a handful of
variables. This document is the complete reference; for a task-oriented walk
through wiring your own systems, see [INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md).

## Required (every role)

| Env var | Description |
|---|---|
| `SHN_DISCOVERY_URL` | The single anchor — resolves the network's trust-plane endpoints (Hub, Authorization Framework, registrar, consent, audit, PHG, …) and trust anchors. Example: `https://accounts.shn-preview.org/discovery`. |
| `ROLE` | `provider`, `payer`, `facility`, or `phg`. Must match the role you registered. |
| `SHN_SECRETS` | Path to the bundle directory written by `shn register -out`. |

## Validation (required to boot — FR-36)

The gateway **refuses to start without a FHIR validator** — every resource is
validated at your gateway's own edge before the leg proceeds. The published
discovery descriptor does not advertise a validator, so you must supply one:

| Env var | Description |
|---|---|
| `FHIR_VALIDATE_URL` | A FHIR `$validate` endpoint (a HAPI server with the Da Vinci CRD/DTR/PAS + US Core IGs loaded). The production path. |
| `SHN_FAKE_VALIDATOR` | Set to `1` to use a no-op validator. **Dev only** — skips real profile validation. Use for a first wiring smoke test; never in production. |

If neither is set (and discovery advertises none), the gateway exits with
`refusing to run without per-message validation (FR-36)`.

**Recommended: co-locate the validator in your own boundary.** Run the IG-loaded
`$validate` as a sidecar alongside the gateway and point `FHIR_VALIDATE_URL` at it
(e.g. `http://validator:8080/fhir`). Because `$validate` needs the full (PHI-bearing)
resource, co-location keeps PHI **inside your boundary** — it is never sent to an
SHN-operated validator. This is the config-only deployment posture: the gateway image
plus a co-located IG-loaded validator, with no separate validator host to stand up.

This repository ships that wiring ready-made: **`deploy/bundle/compose.yml`** pairs the
gateway with a co-located IG-loaded `$validate` sidecar as a config-only unit. Clone the
repo, set `SHN_DISCOVERY_URL` / `ROLE` / `SHN_SECRETS`, and
`docker compose -f deploy/bundle/compose.yml up --build` — no separate validator host.
See [`deploy/bundle/README.md`](../deploy/bundle/README.md).

## Per-role

| Env var | Applies to | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PAYER_DIRECTORY` | provider | **Static override.** Path to a JSON file mapping a member's Coverage payor identity (`{"system","value"}`) to the payer holder id you originate to. When set, it takes precedence over the default feed-derived routing described below — use it for bootstrap/testing, or when you route to a payer that does not publish its identity in the network feed. Example row: `[{"system":"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.6.300","value":"00001","holderId":"payer"}]`. |

**Payer routing is coverage-derived, off the network feed by default (FR-G41).** A provider
gateway resolves the recipient of every payer leg from the patient's **own Coverage** payor
identity — there is **no default payer**. By default it uses `FeedPayerRouter`: it indexes the
converged `/holders` feed, where each `role=payer` holder publishes its operator-attested payer
identities (`payerIds`), and maps `Coverage.payor → holder id`. This is the drop-in, many-to-many
property — a new payer holder self-registers its identity and providers discover it with **no
config change**. Resolution is fail-closed: a miss (no coverage / no parseable payer / no holder
claims that identity) **fails closed with 422**, and an ambiguous identity claimed by more than one
holder also fails closed (`AI-G12`). Set `PAYER_DIRECTORY` only to override this default with a
static map.

The trust and resolution model behind this — how a payer's identity gets published into the
network feed, how the payload-blind Hub maps a holder id to a gateway URL, and the failure modes
at each stage — is covered in the SHN participant onboarding materials referenced from
`PARTICIPANT_PROTOCOL.md` in the `shn-sdk` repo.

**How a payer publishes its identity into the feed (payer-onboarding path).** A payer identity is
**operator-attested, never self-asserted** (`AI-G12`/`OWD-G11`): the applicant *claims* its payer
identities on the access request; the operator *vouches* them at approval (into the org's
authorized grant); and client registration enforces `declared ⊆ authorized` before the identity
lands in the registrar (`UNIQUE(system,value)` globally). Only then does a provider's
`FeedPayerRouter` route to it.

Responder roles (`payer`/`facility`/`phg`) need no `PAYER_DIRECTORY`: they receive
at `POST /substrate/inbound` and reply to whoever the Hub delivers from. A payer
adjudicates with a built-in default decision policy out of the box — plug in your
own via [INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md#payer-decisioning).

## Networking

| Env var | Description |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | Listening port. Default `8080`. |
| `HOST` | Bind address. Default `0.0.0.0`. |

## Observer stream (optional — local tooling)

The gateway can emit a live, structured stream of its own leg, ingress, and
validation events over a loopback-only SSE endpoint — a window onto what this
gateway is doing, for local tooling (for example, the SHN Kit's flow
inspector) rather than another participant. It is off unless configured, and
the address it binds must be loopback: **the events include the request/response
payloads flowing through this gateway's edge, so enabling it exposes the
contents of exchanges with your connected systems to whatever process you
point it at** — treat it like any other local access to your data, not a
network-facing feature.

| Env var | Description |
|---|---|
| `OBSERVER_ADDR` | Loopback `host:port` for the observer stream (SSE `GET /events`, `GET /health`): structured leg/ingress/validation events **including request/response payloads as seen at this gateway's edge**. Off unless set; non-loopback values are refused at startup. Intended for local tooling (the SHN Kit flow inspector); enabling it exposes payloads from your connected systems to local processes. |

## Connect your system of record

See [INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md) for how these fit together.

| Env var | Description |
|---|---|
| `ORIGINATION_PROFILE` | provider. Set to `provider-data` to originate every prior-auth UC off your seeded FHIR system of record and drive real payer verdicts — the config-only provider lane, no custom code. When set to `provider-data`, `PROVIDER_DTR_POPULATE_URL` is required (validated at boot). |
| `FHIR_DATA_URL` | FHIR R4 base URL for your system of record. **Omit to use the built-in synthetic stub** (seeded with example personas, so you can run end to end with no backend). |
| `FHIR_TOKEN_URL` | SMART Backend Services token endpoint, if your FHIR server requires authenticated access. Requires the client quad below. |
| `FHIR_CLIENT_ID` | SMART client id. |
| `FHIR_CLIENT_KEY` | Path to the SMART client's private-key PEM file (the value is a path, not the key text — mount the file into the container). |
| `FHIR_CLIENT_ALG` | `ES384` or `RS384`. |
| `FHIR_CLIENT_SCOPE` | Requested scope. Default `system/*.read` — must be a scope your server grants this client. |
| `FHIR_CLIENT_KID` | Key id for the client assertion JWK, if your server requires it. |
| `SHN_STORE_DATABASE_URL` | Postgres DSN for durable claim-state storage. Omit for in-memory (non-durable across restarts). |

## Accept Da Vinci requests from a provider EHR (provider, optional)

See [INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md#native-da-vinci-ingress) for when to use this
instead of `provider-data` origination.

Set `PROVIDER_DAVINCI_INGRESS=1` to mount the provider-side Da Vinci ingress: the
gateway accepts a provider EHR / reference-implementation's **native Da Vinci
requests** — CDS Hooks order-select (Coverage Requirements Discovery),
`Questionnaire/$questionnaire-package` (DTR), and `Claim/$submit` (PAS) — resolves
and inlines the payer's prefetch from **your own system of record** (non-aggregating;
no callback to the provider), and forwards conformant requests through to the Hub.

Inbound requests authenticate via **SMART Backend Services**: the gateway hosts its
own `POST /oauth/token` and `GET /.well-known/smart-configuration`, verifies a
registered client's signed JWT assertion (`private_key_jwt`, ES384/RS384), issues a
short-lived bearer, and verifies it on every ingress call.

| Env var | Description |
|---|---|
| `PROVIDER_DAVINCI_INGRESS` | Set to `1` to mount the ingress on the provider gateway. |
| `PROVIDER_DAVINCI_INGRESS_BASE_URL` | The gateway's public base URL — the SMART audience the gateway pins and the token endpoint it advertises. **Required** when the ingress is enabled. |
| `INGRESS_CLIENTS_FILE` | Path to a JSON array of registered inbound clients: `[{"client_id":"…","alg":"ES384","public_key_pem":"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----…","scopes":["system/Davinci.write"]}]`. **Required** (≥1 client) when the ingress is enabled. |

Enabling the ingress without a base URL or at least one valid registered client is a
hard startup error.

**This ingress is a private, within-boundary surface, not a public endpoint.** The
gateway's only public-internet leg is the gateway↔Hub connection; every connection to
your own systems — including this ingress — is private/within-boundary. Your EHR or
reference implementation calls it from inside your own network, authenticating as one
of the clients pre-registered in `INGRESS_CLIENTS_FILE`. There is no plan to expose
this ingress on the public internet. Dynamic client registration (as opposed to the
static file above) remains a tracked enhancement.

## Advanced overrides (rarely needed)

Each network endpoint and trust-anchor key URL is resolved from discovery by
default; set the matching variable only to override (e.g. when the gateway runs
inside the SHN-operated network itself): `AUTHZ_URL`, `HUB_URL`, `CONSENT_URL`,
`AUDIT_URL`, `PHG_URL`, `REGISTRAR_URL`, `FHIR_VALIDATE_URL`, `AUTHZ_PUBKEY_URL`,
`HUB_TRANSPORT_KEY_URL`. Explicit env always wins over discovery. `NPI` overrides
the organization NPI stamped into a provider's originated requests (defaults to a
synthetic placeholder).

## Native-forward payer mode (`PAYER_DAVINCI_*`)

See [INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md#native-forward-payer-mode) for what native-forward
mode does and when to use it, and
[Authenticating to your backend](INTEGRATION.md#authenticating-to-your-backend-smart-backend-services)
for how to set up the SMART Backend Services credentials (asymmetric
`private_key_jwt`, ES384/RS384 — there is no shared-secret option).

| Env var | Description |
|---|---|
| `PAYER_DAVINCI_BASE_URL` | Base URL of the partner Da Vinci payer (e.g. `https://api.payer.example/davinci`). Setting this enables native-forward mode. |
| `PAYER_DAVINCI_CDS_BASE_URL` | Base URL for the partner's CDS Hooks (CRD) posts when they are **not** co-located with the FHIR base — e.g. a payer that serves `/cds-services` at the root but FHIR ops under `/fhir`. Empty ⇒ CDS uses `PAYER_DAVINCI_BASE_URL`. |
| `PAYER_DAVINCI_TOKEN_URL` | SMART Backend Services token endpoint for the partner. Required if the partner requires authentication. |
| `PAYER_DAVINCI_CLIENT_ID` | SMART client id for the partner. Required when `PAYER_DAVINCI_TOKEN_URL` is set. |
| `PAYER_DAVINCI_CLIENT_KEY` | Path to the SMART client's private-key PEM file (the value is a path, not the key text — mount the file into the container). Required when `PAYER_DAVINCI_TOKEN_URL` is set. |
| `PAYER_DAVINCI_CLIENT_ALG` | `ES384` or `RS384`. Required when `PAYER_DAVINCI_TOKEN_URL` is set. |
| `PAYER_DAVINCI_SCOPE` | Requested scope the gateway asks your token endpoint for. Default `system/*.read` (covers the read-only legs). Must be a scope your authorization server grants this client; widen it if you enable `PAYER_DAVINCI_PAS_NATIVE`. |
| `PAYER_DAVINCI_CLIENT_KID` | Key id for the client assertion JWK, if the partner requires it. |
| `PAYER_DAVINCI_PAS_NATIVE` | `true` to forward PAS submit/update legs to the partner's `/Claim/$submit`. Default `false` (built-in PAS fallback). Requires a payer Store. |
| `PAYER_DAVINCI_CRD_SERVICE_ID` | Escape-hatch override for the partner's order-select CDS service id. Empty ⇒ the gateway fetches `{base}/cds-services` at boot and auto-selects the single order-select service (fails closed if none, or ambiguous). Set it when the partner's CRD service isn't uniquely discoverable. |
| `PAYER_DAVINCI_CRD_HOOK` | CDS Hooks hook value to stamp on the CRD request before forwarding (e.g. a partner whose service expects `order-sign`). Empty ⇒ forward the originator's hook verbatim. |
| `PAYER_DAVINCI_DISPATCH_SERVICE_ID` | The partner's CDS service id for the `crd-order-dispatch` leg. **Empty ⇒ the dispatch leg fails closed (502)** — set it if your flow uses order-dispatch. |
| `PAYER_DAVINCI_DISPATCH_HOOK` | CDS Hooks hook value to stamp on the order-dispatch request before forwarding. Empty ⇒ forward the originator's hook verbatim. |
| `PAYER_DAVINCI_CRD_COVERAGE_BUNDLE` | `true` to wrap the CRD request's bare `prefetch.coverage` in a searchset `Bundle` on egress — for a partner whose `order-sign` `coverage` prefetch is a search template that requires a Bundle (a bare `Coverage` returns 412). Default off ⇒ forwarded verbatim. |

**All-or-nothing rule:** if `PAYER_DAVINCI_TOKEN_URL` is set, then
`PAYER_DAVINCI_CLIENT_ID`, `PAYER_DAVINCI_CLIENT_KEY`, and
`PAYER_DAVINCI_CLIENT_ALG` must also be set — a partial credential block is a
hard startup error (a likely misconfig). Setting `PAYER_DAVINCI_BASE_URL` alone
(no token URL) is valid and forwards to the partner **unauthenticated** — the
gateway logs a warning on startup to make this mode visible.

## Provider DTR population (`PROVIDER_DTR_*`)

See [INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md#provider-dtr-population) for the managed-vs-native
tradeoff.

| Env var | Description |
|---|---|
| `PROVIDER_DTR_NATIVE` | `true` to forward DTR population to an SDC `$populate` engine instead of the managed populator. Default `false`. |
| `PROVIDER_DTR_POPULATE_URL` | The SDC `Questionnaire/$populate` endpoint. Required when `PROVIDER_DTR_NATIVE=true`. |

## Sealed message frames (v1)

When your gateway is the **recipient** of an exchange (it answers a request routed
through the Hub — the payer/responder side), an application-level failure from the far
end — e.g. the payer's real `502` + `OperationOutcome`, or a `422` amendment rejection —
used to be collapsed into a generic `502 {"error":"hub routing failed"}` at the
requester's edge, because a non-`2xx` answer to the Hub was treated as a routing failure.

As of v0.28.0, a capable pair of gateways instead exchanges a **sealed message
frame**: the responder's real answer — its actual status, an allowlisted `Content-Type`
header, and its body, success or not — travels *inside* the sealed response leg and is
surfaced to the requester **verbatim**. The Hub stays payload-blind throughout: it still
only ever sees an opaque ciphertext and records the leg as `answered` over its hash, never
the status or body inside it. A true **transport fault** (the far end is unreachable, or
the gateway's own build/dial/read fails) is not an application answer and still surfaces
as `"hub routing failed"` — only a response the far end actually produced is relayed.

**Negotiation, not configuration.** There is no environment variable to set. Whether an
exchange frames is decided per pair of holders from what each side has advertised to the
registry: every gateway (and SDK-based participant) on a codec-capable build
self-declares message-frame support automatically the moment it registers or rotates its
credentials — no app-level opt-in. A response frames only when **both** the requester and
the responder have advertised support; if either side is still on an older, pre-frame
build, the exchange falls back byte-for-byte to the legacy contract: a bare payload on
success (implicit `200`), and a non-`2xx` application answer collapsing to the Hub's
generic `"hub routing failed"` on failure, exactly as before. Upgrading one gateway in a
mesh is always safe — older peers simply keep the legacy contract until they, too,
re-register from an upgraded build.

**The `RESPONDER_RELAY_ERRORS` environment variable no longer exists.** It gated an
interim, JSON-wrapper-based version of this same idea shipped in v0.27.0; that wrapper,
its flag, and the response sniff it relied on have all been removed and replaced by the
negotiated message frame described above. Deployments that still set
`RESPONDER_RELAY_ERRORS` can drop the variable — it is inert.
