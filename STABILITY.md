# Stability and versioning

## Versioning policy

`shn-gateway` follows semantic versioning. The module is currently **pre-1.0
(0.x)**:

- **MINOR** versions (0.x.0 → 0.(x+1).0) may carry breaking changes. Each
  breaking change is called out in the release changelog.
- **PATCH** versions (0.x.y → 0.x.(y+1)) contain backwards-compatible fixes
  only.

A published version tag is **never re-tagged** with different content. The Go
module proxy caches a tag's tree permanently; always bump to a new version
rather than moving an existing tag.

## Supported seams

Partners may depend on the following packages across minor versions (breaking
changes will be noted in the changelog):

| Package | Description |
|---|---|
| `engine` | Leg-processing core — the `Config`, `Engine`, and `Handler` types; `SystemOfRecord`, `Store`, and `Adjudicator` connector interfaces |
| `app` | Config-only gateway runner — `app.Run` and `app.Handler`/`app.HandlerWithClock` for embedding |
| `connectors/fhirsor` | FHIR-backed `SystemOfRecord` connector |
| `connectors/pgstore` | Postgres-backed `Store` connector |
| `connectors/scaffold` | Runnable `SystemOfRecord` skeleton for custom / legacy backends |
| `connectors/smartauth` | SMART Backend Services HTTP client for FHIR SoR authentication |

## Unsupported internals

`internal/` packages and `cmd/` binaries are implementation details and may
change without notice between any versions. Do not import `internal/`
directly.

## Cross-version conformance contract

The **`shn-sdk` wire vectors** and the **SHN Participant Protocol
specification** (published with `shn-sdk`) are the conformance contract across
gateway versions. A gateway that passes the wire-vector suite is conformant
with the substrate protocol regardless of the gateway version it runs.
